## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at IKEA, I lead the development of AI-driven solutions, including virtual shopping assistants and employee co-pilots, to enhance automation across over 30 markets. My contributions include deploying a scalable MLOps evaluation platform that processes over 20 million daily user interactions, ensuring continuous model optimization. 

With a Master's degree in Embedded and Intelligent Systems from Halmstad University, my expertise spans Generative AI, large language models (LLM), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I aim to bridge cutting-edge AI research with practical engineering to create scalable, production-grade AI solutions.
