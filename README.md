## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Iâ€™m a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** specializing in **Generative AI**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, and **MLOps** â€” building production-grade AI that scales to millions of users.

At **IKEA** and **Capgemini**, Iâ€™ve led teams designing and deploying **LLM-powered assistants**, **evaluation frameworks**, and **enterprise RAG platforms** across **Azure** and **GCP**.  
My work has improved automation, accelerated model deployment, and enabled **secure, large-scale AI adoption** for global enterprises.

Iâ€™m passionate about bridging **cutting-edge AI research** with **practical, scalable engineering** â€” from **prompt optimization** and **embedding pipelines** to **Kubernetes-based ML deployments**.

ðŸ’¡ Always exploring whatâ€™s next in:
- Agentic AI systems  
- LangChain orchestration  
- Cloud-native model serving
